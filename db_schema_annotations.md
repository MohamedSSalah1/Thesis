# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Database: Tables and Annotations

This document outlines the schema of the cardiovascular disease prediction database, including all tables used for storing clinicians, patients, prediction models, risk scores, and output visualisations.

---

## 1. Clinician Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE `Clinician` (
    `clinician_id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,  -- Unique identifier for each clinician
    `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    `email` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  -- Unique email used for login or reference
    `password` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  -- Password for authentication

    PRIMARY KEY (`clinician_id`),
    UNIQUE KEY (`email`)  -- Ensures no duplicate accounts
);
```
Each clinician is uniquely identified and secured. Email is enforced to be unique to prevent duplicate registrations. The primary key (clinician_id) uniquely identifies each clinician. The table includes fields for name), email (VARCHAR with a unique constraint to prevent duplicates), and password (VARCHAR for securely storing credentials). This schema ensures secure and efficient management of clinician accounts within the system.

## 2. Patient Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE `Patient` (
    `patient_id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    `age` INT(11) NOT NULL,
    `clinician_id` INT(11) DEFAULT NULL,  -- Links the patient to their assigned clinician

    PRIMARY KEY (`patient_id`),
    KEY (`clinician_id`),  -- Index to improve JOIN performance
    FOREIGN KEY (`clinician_id`) REFERENCES `Clinician`(`clinician_id`)
);
```
Each patient record optionally links to a clinician, supporting multi-user environments.This table stores patient demographic information and links each patient to their assigned clinician. The primary key (patient_id) uniquely identifies each patient. The clinician_id field serves as a foreign key, establishing a relationship with the Clinicians table to track which clinician is responsible for each patient. This schema ensures structured patient data management within the system

---

## 3. Model Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE `Model` (
    `model_id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `model_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  -- E.g. 'Classical COX-PH Model', 'Elastic Net COX-PH' 
    `model_type` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,  -- E.g. 'CNN', 'XGBoost', 'Logistic Regression'

    PRIMARY KEY (`model_id`)
);
```
Stores metadata about ML models used in the risk prediction pipeline. The primary key (model_id) is an uniquely identifies each model. The model_name field stores the model’s name, while model_type categorises the model (e.g., Cox-PH). This schema allows efficient organisation and retrieval of trained models within the system.

## 4. Risk Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE `Risk` (
    `risk_id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `patient_id` INT(11) NOT NULL,
    `model_id` INT(11) NOT NULL,
    `risk_score` DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,  -- Risk prediction output (0.00 to 100.00)
    `prediction_date` TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    PRIMARY KEY (`risk_id`),
    KEY (`patient_id`),
    KEY (`model_id`),
    FOREIGN KEY (`patient_id`) REFERENCES `Patient`(`patient_id`),
    FOREIGN KEY (`model_id`) REFERENCES `Model`(`model_id`)
);
```
Tracks all prediction outputs per patient/model combination. Scores are timestamped and stored with precision. This table stores cardiovascular disease risk predictions generated by machine learning models. The primary key (risk_id) uniquely identifies each risk assessment instance. The patient_id field links the prediction to a specific patient, while model_id  references the ML model used for risk estimation. The risk_score field (DECIMAL) stores the predicted risk percentage, and prediction_date (TIMESTAMP) records the time the prediction was generated, with a default value of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP. Additionally, the table is designed to later include all patient-specific features from the dataset, allowing comprehensive storage of both input variables and model outputs. This structure enables tracking of risk assessment trends and feature contributions over time.

---

## 5. Output Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE `Output` (
    `output_id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `risk_id` INT(11) NOT NULL,  -- Links to a specific risk prediction
    `plot_type` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,  -- E.g. 'ROC Curve', 'Confusion Matrix'
    `generated_at` TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    PRIMARY KEY (`output_id`),
    KEY (`risk_id`),
    FOREIGN KEY (`risk_id`) REFERENCES `Risk`(`risk_id`)
);
```
Stores visual output metadata generated after model inference — e.g., ROC curves, heatmaps etc. This table stores generated visualisations and reports related to cardiovascular disease risk predictions. The primary key (output_id)  uniquely identifies each output. The risk_id field  acts as a foreign key linking outputs to specific risk scores. The plot_type field specifies the type of visualization. The generated_at field (TIMESTAMP) records the creation time of each output, with a default value of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for automatic logging.

---

## 6. Model_Features Join Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE `Model_Features` (
    `model_id` INT(11) NOT NULL,
    `feature_id` INT(11) NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY (`model_id`, `feature_id`),  -- Composite primary key
    FOREIGN KEY (`model_id`) REFERENCES `ML_Models`(`model_id`),
    FOREIGN KEY (`feature_id`) REFERENCES `Features`(`feature_id`)
);
```
This table represents a many-to-many relationship between machine learning models and the features they use. The purpose of the Model_Features table is to associate specific features with specific machine learning models, especially because:
- One feature (like “age”) can be used by multiple models
- One model (like “Lasso Cox”) can use multiple features

So this is a classic many-to-many relationship, and Model_Features is the join/association table between ML_Models and Features.

## Notes
- All primary keys are `AUTO_INCREMENT` integers for easy reference.
- Timestamp fields (`prediction_date`, `generated_at`) allow for auditing model performance over time.
- Relationships are clearly defined using foreign keys — ensuring referential integrity across patients, clinicians, models, and predictions.
- The design supports future extensions such as uploading actual image outputs or prediction reports.
